                    <h3>Supplemental Instructor (SI) - CALC II</h3>
    <p>
		University Of Massachusetts Amherst  | 08/2022 - present
    </p>
    <p>
		I was an SI leader for Calculus 2 helping students succeed in the course, forming new relations, working on my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I improved my leadership skills, work ethic, professionalism, and public speaking skills.
        
        
    </p>
    <ul>
		<li>Teach 400+ students CALC II  </li>
        <li>Hold exam review sessions of two hours (recorded to be watched again for students unable to attend)</li>
		<li>Create worksheets twice per week and hold two sessions of one hour fifteen minutes each</li>
		<li>Attend several training sessions held by the LRC</li>
		<li>Design several cheat sheets for students to help them review</li>
		<li>Take part of the class lectures (taking notes, setting the example...)</li>
		<li>Coordinate with the course chair sending weekly emails and chatting after every lecture</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conversation Partner Spoken Arabic Program (Levantine II)</h3>
    <p>
		Five College Center for World Languages  | 09/2022 - present
    </p>
    <p>
		I facilitated learning for students from the Five College Consortium taking the course Levantine 2. I planned several activities for our weekly sessions and filed a report after each session stating how 
		it went. I prepared them for the final oral exam worth forty percent of their total grade.
    </p>
    <ul>
		<li>Lead speaking activities</li>
		<li>Created and reviewed weekly lesson plans with supervisors</li>
		<li>Planned role-plays to get students ready for real life events</li>
		<li>Built fun and supportive environment for learners</li>
        <li>Provided feedback to faculty after each session filling a report</li>
		<li>Attended training sessions</li>
    </ul>

			<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
            <!-- your work experience club involvment, volunteer experiencem, hackathon!!!!-->
		<li>Project Clue: Created a murder mystery game using C inspired by the game Cluedo.</li>
		<li> Project Booking a Covid Appointment: In this project I used threads, semaphores (binary and
			counting) written in C. This is a simulation of making the appointment for the COVID Test by multiple
			people at the same time. This illustrates threads, synchronization, and critical sections.</li>
        <li>Project Statistics Bot: Implemented a network client that will communicate to a remote server in C.
			The server responds to the client with a series of simple statistics problems that will be solved. Used
			various system calls provided by the socket API.
			</li> 
		<li>Project Graph Coloring: Implemented a graph structure and a graph coloring algorithm in Java. Used the
			graph and graph-coloring algorithm to solve various problems involving conflict resolution and finding
			an optimal assignment of resources to accomplish a task or goal.
			</li>
		<li>Project Hashtable Database: Used hashtable implementation as a storage for login credentials,
			username and password, for a website in Java. The password is stored in encrypted form for security.
			This is an industry standard practice.
			</li>
		<li>Project Prioritizing Streaming Data: Implemented a data structure called a priority queue â€“ more
			specifically, a heap-based priority queue in Java. A futuristic automated emergency room (ER) triage
			system. The system receives data in the form of patient and injury pairs over time and automatically
			assigns patients to doctors as the resources become available depending on the severity of the
			patients injury.</li>
		<li>Project Oracle: Developed using JS an oracle to test (possibly broken) solutions to the Stable
			Matching Problem</li>
		<li>Project Interpreter: Wrote using JS an interpreter for a small programming language similar to JavaScript.
			 Used a parser to turn the program's concrete syntax into an abstract syntax tree.</li>
